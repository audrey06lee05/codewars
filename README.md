# ✏️ Codewars Records
✨ This is a repository that stores the Codewars Katas I did. <br/><br/>
✨ I find this extremely useful as it makes GitHub record my code activity even though I am not working on projects. 

## 🔧 Set Up 
1. Download CodeHub on Chrome Extensions Store
2. Create a repository on your github account
3. Press the CodeHub extension and fill in the repository name
4. Do Codewars Katas and it will **automatically** add files into the repository

##### I hope you find this useful!
